## About

Tourism Australia seeks to improve its marketing efforts and their ability to provide timely
insights to the international and domestic travel industry to assist them in selling Australia as
a destination. To achieve this, Tourism Australia requires a strong understanding of the seat
supply and travel demand, which requires efficient and accurate methods of gathering
performance indicators such as Available Seat kilometres (ASKs), Flight LFs, and Airline
Yield. Currently, the data required for these KPIs is difficult to access and presents a
time-consuming challenge, hindering Tourism Australiaâ€™s decision-making process.
